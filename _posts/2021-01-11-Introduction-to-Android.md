## About Android
Android is a mobile operating system built on the Linux Kernel, designed primarily for smartphones and tablets. It is sponsored by Google, and the first commercial android device was launched in September 2008.

## Gradle with Android
Gradle is a build service. While working with android, there are a lot of files in an app, each has to be compiled multiple times to build an apk, so it is too difficult to do all the work manually, so gradle simplifies the work by doing all the tasks automatically with a build script, which is time saving and effort saving.
