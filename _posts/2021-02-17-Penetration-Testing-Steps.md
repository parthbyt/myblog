## Footprinting
Footprinting is technique for gathering information about computers and their owners. It  is generally used for gathering vulnerabilities of system and can be very useful to a hacker.

## Scanning and enumeration
It is the face where the attacker begins to enter the system. The attacker scans and detects live hosts and ports on a network. Then the hacker enumerates them to discover resources on network.

## System Hacking
System hacking means to hock systems and software to steal or misuse sensitive information. Hackers exploit vulnerabilities to gain access to data and take illegal advantage.

## Backdoor
Backdoor is any method used by attacker to get root access on a computer, software or network.

## Covering Tracks
Covering tracks refers to erase all the digital signs which proves the attacker’s presence in the targeted system. It is one of the most important steps of penetration testing.
