Here is a tutorial on how to send a fake email.

## Step 1: Get a fake email address.

So first of all you need to get a fake email address. I used [https://tempmail.net/](https://tempmail.net/) but you may use one you like.

Go to [https://tempmail.net/](https://tempmail.net/) . There you will get a fake email address.

## Step 2: Sending a mail.

Now we will send the email. You can send it to your mail box. We will use [https://emkei.cz/](https://emkei.cz/) .

1.	Go to [https://emkei.cz/](https://emkei.cz/)
2.	Fill appropriate credentials. Type any name in name field. Put tempmail address in from mail and type your email address in To field. Add subject and content as you like. Then hit send.
